rsspusher
=========

Subscribes to feeds and notifies you, in realtime if possible, of updates to the feed.

See the [demo](http://rsspusher.eu01.aws.af.cm/) for an explanation.

Install
=======
```bash
git clone https://github.com/onli/rsspusher.git
cd rsspusher
bundle install
```
Now, either set it up on appfog, or modify the code in the database.rb to either use your psotgresql-database or change it back to sqlite (uncomment the code)
