            What is rsspusher?
        %p
            rsspusher is a service where you can subscribe to a feed. It will send the updates of the feed to a callback-URL you specify. Think
            %a{href: "http://superfeedr.com/"}
                superfeedr
            in amateurish and free.

        %p
            It is thought as helpful building-block for those developers building their own RSS Reader after Google Readers shutdown.

        %h2
            Protocol
        %ol
            %li
                %p
                    You send a json-object containing an array of URLs to subscribe to and the callback. Example:
                %pre
                    wget -O - -q #{request.host}/watches --post-data='{"urls": ["http://www.example.com/"], "callback": "http://www.example.com/callback"}
            %li
                rsspusher will send the callback a GET-request containing a challenge your callback has to repeat. Example:
                %pre= "require 'sinatra'\n\nget '/' do\n    return param[\"challenge\"]\nend"
            %li
                As soon as rsspusher notices an update, it will POST your callback with the parameters :url, containing the url of the feed, and :newEntries, containing an json-object with the new items of the feed since the last update.
            %li
                %p
                    To unsubscribe, repeat steps 1 and 2 with a DELETE request. Example:
                %pre
                    curl -X DELETE #{request.host}/watches --data '{"urls": ["http://www.example.com/"], "callback": "http://www.example.com/callback"}'

        %h2
            How does it work internally?
        %p
            Instead of polling all the given feeds, it tries to subscribe to them using
            %a{href: "https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/"} pubsubhubbub
            or
            %a{href: "http://rsscloud.org/"} rsscloud
            (both used by blogs on wordpress.com).
            If it can't subscribe to them, it resorts to polling them regularly. Yahoo Pipes are used to convert the feeds to json and for some additional stuff.
            But see for yourself,
            %a{title: "onli/rsspusher - Github", href: "https://github.com/onli/rsspusher"} the code is on github
            \.
             
        %h2
            How to test it?
        %p
            This is a demo, running on a free
            %a{href: "https://www.appfog.com/"} appfog-instance
            \. You can subscribe to a feed using this demo-installation and it will notify you of updates, if everything works. You could also
            %a{title: "onli/rsspusher - Github", href: "https://github.com/onli/rsspusher"} grab the code
            and test it locally.
